# lib/features/

Feature modules. Each module owns its screens, Riverpod providers, and local data models. No feature imports from another feature — cross-cutting concerns (DB, sync, format engine) live in `lib/services/` and `lib/database/`.

---

## Module Structure

Every feature follows the same layout:

```
features/<name>/
├── presentation/
│   ├── <name>_screen.dart      # Root screen widget
│   └── widgets/                # Screen-specific sub-widgets
├── providers/                  # Riverpod providers + notifiers
└── data/                       # Static data, models, or service wrappers
```
