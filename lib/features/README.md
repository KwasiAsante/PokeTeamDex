# lib/features/

Feature modules. Each module owns its screens, Riverpod providers, and local data models. No feature imports from another feature — cross-cutting concerns (DB, sync, format engine) live in `lib/services/` and `lib/database/`.

---

## Module Structure

Every feature follows the same layout:

```text
features/<name>/
├── presentation/
│   ├── <name>_screen.dart      # Root screen widget
│   └── widgets/                # Screen-specific sub-widgets
├── providers/                  # Riverpod providers + notifiers
└── data/                       # Static data, models, or service wrappers
```

## Feature Index

### `pokedex/`

Pokémon browser across all 9 generations.

| Screen | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `PokemonListScreen` | Infinite-scroll list (50/page); search, gen/type/game filter, sort; form chip on every tile/card |
| `PokemonDetailScreen` | Tabbed detail: Overview, Stats, Abilities, Moves, Evolutions, Forms, Locations |
| `FormPickerSheet` (`presentation/widget/`) | Bottom-sheet form picker opened from list card chips and detail header |

Notable behaviours:

- **Hero animation** — sprite transitions from list card to detail header
- **Adaptive layout** — tab bar becomes a left sidebar on wide screens (> 840dp)
- **Stat bars** — staggered animated fill using `AnimationController`
- **Favorites** — star button writes to the `Favorites` Drift table
- **Form switching** — form chip on list tiles and grid cards; selecting a form updates the sprite, gradient, and display name in place; covers battle-meaningful variety forms, cosmetic variety forms, and form-entry cosmetics

`logic/` files:

- `form_filter.dart` — `filterFormChips()`: determines which form chips to show for a species, gated by generation and prerequisite item/ability
- `evolution_chain_builder.dart` — builds a typed evolution tree from PokéAPI `evolution_chain` JSON

### `teams/`

The core team builder feature — the most complex module.

| Screen | Description |

| `TeamDetailScreen` | 6-slot list with filled/empty slot cards; Showdown export; format picker; rename |
| `SlotPickerScreen` | Browse Pokédex to assign a Pokémon to a slot (format auto-filters to eligible Pokémon) |

- Level slider (1–100)
- Gender chips + shiny toggle + friendship slider
- Ability cards — gen-gated (hidden abilities hidden for Gen 1–4; abilities not yet introduced hidden by format gen)
- Nature dropdown (25 natures with stat deltas inline)
- Held item — searchable picker with sprite + effect
- 4 Move slots — learnable moves filtered by generation/format
- EV grid (0–252/stat, 510 total cap with overflow block)

- Tera Type selector (18-type chips, Gen 9 / SV formats only)
- Ribbon catalog — gen-gated chip-grid picker

- Contest stat sliders + radar chart (Gen 3–4 / no-format only)
- Pokémon Identity section (instance chain browser)

`data/` files:

- `form_data.dart` — PS form exception maps and cosmetic sprite stem constants
- `form_descriptor.dart` — `FormDescriptor` value object: bundles form name, sprite hint, and battle-meaningful flag

`logic/` files:

- `ps_form_resolver.dart` — heuristics for resolving a PS form name from PokéAPI variety name; exceptions-first lookup

**`services/showdown_export.dart`** — `buildShowdownExport(team, slots)` produces standard Showdown `.txt` format.
